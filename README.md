Analysis of Aberdeen Air Quality sensor data

This project aims to analyse and visualise the data generated from [the project](https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Air_Quality_Monitor) led by the 57 North hacklab to help citizens deploy their own air quality sensors. 

Once done, we should look at data from the [official monitoring equipment](http://www.scottishairquality.co.uk/latest/site-info.php?site_id=ABD0&view=latest).
